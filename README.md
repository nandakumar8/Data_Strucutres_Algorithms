Data Structures and algorithms using simple java code

Various different data structures and algorithms have been implemented using Java code. All code have been referred from the book “Data structures and algorithms in Java” by Robert Lafore. This book clearly explains the concepts in lucid way and in my opinion one of the best books on data structures and algorithms.
